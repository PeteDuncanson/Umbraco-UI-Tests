This folder contains everything to do with V7 back office automated tests. 

These are purposefully separate from the V8 tests and code. This does mean that there might be some duplication but we expect the two code bases to go in different directions and at some point we will stop working on the V7 code base. Having them separate from the off means we have a nice clean version of the tests for V8 moving forward.

By all means keep developing tests for V7, that version is going to be around and worked on for another year at least and so it will be good to have these tests in place.
